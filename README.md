The provided code simulates a basic Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system, encapsulated within a class named UPI. Upon initialization, it sets the balance to zero, a default PIN, and initializes a list for storing transactions. Users interact with the system through a menu-driven interface within the main() function. They can perform operations like checking balance, depositing, withdrawing, resetting PIN, and viewing past transactions. The program ensures security by verifying the PIN before allowing access to sensitive operations. Overall, this concise Python script provides a practical simulation of a UPI system, offering essential functionalities for managing account transactions with ease and security.
